You see there file in source code that named as sketch_uefitest.ino, download it and then open it in arduino ide and upload it. If is it broken then try to port.

Ah. If it not arduino, then try to port everything but as other likely micro python or other board. If it arduino and something wrong, try to fix code, add fixes or change something. Read wiki if u dont know
